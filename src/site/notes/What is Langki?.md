## What is Langki?

Langki is an AI-based framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with spaced repetition systems (SRS). The framework aims to extend the basic features of Anki flashcards to offer an all-in-one toolkit for language learners. The name 'Langki' is a blend of 'language' and 'Anki'.

## Features

### Batteries-included

Langki has all essential built-in functionalities for language learners, including AI chatbot, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and speech analysis that grades learners' pronunciation.

### Highly customizable

Langki is just a template (or note type), which means users can easily clone and modify it to suit their own needs. From the prompt that guides AI behavior to the reference information that helps prevent hallucinations, users have full control over the flashcard and AI responses, opening up many possibilities.

### Flashcard generation

Langki helps users create flashcards efficiently without the need for any third-party tools, both on desktop and mobile.

### Multi-language support

While Langki is pre-configured for English, you can easily switch voices or configure speech analysis for other languages with just a few tweaks.

### Facilitate open-ended questions

Interact with an AI assistant directly within your flashcards. By removing the need for rote memorization, learners can respond in their own words, promoting deeper understanding.

### Free to use

No sign-up is required, just install the add-on and download the Langki note type. You can jump right in and start using all of Langki's features.

> [!Notice]
> To ensure everyone can access Langki, a monthly quota is in place. All of Langki's features cost money and time to maintain. If you're a power user, consider subscribing to support the project and remove all usage limits.

### Work on both desktop and mobile

While the desktop version needs an addon to work properly, mobile users can review Langki flashcards on Ankiweb.

> Ankidroid and Ankimobile are still not supported due to technical barriers.
